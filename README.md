# terraforming_mars

My friend and I created this game in our free time because we enjoy the board game. The game is played through the command prompt and is still not finished.

We did not copy this code from anywhere. This was done as a fun side project and is not licenses or anything, it is also far from finished and is only at its very simple form.
