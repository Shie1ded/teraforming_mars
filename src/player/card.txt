Flagged Abilities (unfinished):
1. Add_Animal_Counter - need to add animal counter mechanic
2. Place_Noctis_City, Place_Phobos_Space_Haven - need to add "player owning city" mechanic


How to add abilities
1. Create a new ability in the Ability.java file (try to organize it)
2. Go to abilities file.
	2.1 add a description
	2.2 add it in the activate function
		If it is a one-time function, make it return false. Otherwise make it a boolean and copy the boolean code
	2.3 determine if you need a validator (ie a condition that must be met to play the card, only if it is a non-repeating card)
	2.4 if you need a validator, go to hasRequirement, add it, return false
		Then go to the satisfiesRequirement, add a row there
		Then go to AbilityRequirements and add a function to check if it can be satisfied.
3. Test it
